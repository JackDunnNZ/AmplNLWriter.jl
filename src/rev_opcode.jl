"""
    _JULIA_TO_AMPL

This dictionary is manualy curated, based on the list of opcodes in `opcode.jl`.

The goal is to map Julia functions to their AMPL opcode equivalent.

Sometimes, there is ambiguity, such as the `:+`, which Julia uses for unary,
binary, and n-ary addition, while AMPL doesn't support unary addition, uses
OPPLUS for binary, and OPSUMLIST for n-ary. In these cases, introduce a
different symbol to disambiguate them in the context of this dictionary, and add
logic to `_process_call` to rewrite the Julia expression.

Commented out lines are opcodes supported by AMPL that don't have a clear Julia
equivalent. If you can think of one, feel free to add it. But then go and make
similar changes to `_AMPL_TO_JULIA` and `_NARY_OPCODES`.

The goal is to map AMPL opcodes to their Julia equivalents. In addition, we need
to know the arity of each opcode.
